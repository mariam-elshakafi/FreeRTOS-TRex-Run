You can check the game in action [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5NhWZFaGhNk-mt4ke8N56P_wGSc5tb1/view?usp=sharing).

_Note:_
Yeah, It's not a T-Rex.
Also, the LCD driver here is not real-time at all as it's using a blocking delay :D
However, this shouldn't be a problem for this particular project.
